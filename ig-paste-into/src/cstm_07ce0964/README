DESCRIPTION

    Paste Into pastes clipboard files into a single selected folder, or else 
    into the current folder.  It is intended to replace or supplement 
    SpaceFM's built-in Paste command.


DEPENDENCIES

    spacefm >= 0.8.7


INSTRUCTIONS

    First, copy or cut one or more files or folders to the clipboard with 
    the standard Copy or Cut commands.
    
    Then select (highlight) a single folder to paste into, and select the 
    Paste Into command.  Or, if a single folder is not selected, files will 
    be pasted into the current folder.

    If the clipboard contains text instead of files, Paste Into will paste the
    clipboard text in the pathbar.


SUPPORT
