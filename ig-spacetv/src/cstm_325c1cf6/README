DESCRIPTION

The IG SpaceTV plugin is ideal for an HTPC setup or any media PC.

SpaceTV adds resumable video playback to SpaceFM via the mpv video player.
mpv is an actively developed and feature-rich fork of the mplayer/mplayer2
video players.  See http://mpv.io

SpaceTV allows you to play videos in fullscreen without a video player
window, resuming videos from their last position and restoring mpv volume
and other settings.  It can also resume the last played video or prior
videos.  mpv options may be set globally and on a per video basis.

SpaceTV adds the following commands to SpaceFM:

    Play Video      Plays the selected video(s) in mpv and saves a resume
                    point.  Press Q to quit mpv.

    Play Video w/ Options
                    Prompts for options to play the selected video(s).

    Resume Last     Resumes playing the last unfinished video.

    Resume Prior    Shifts the last played video down and resumes the prior
                    video.  Use repeatedly to move backward through videos.

    Browse Unfinished
                    Opens the folder containing links to unfinished videos.

    Options         Opens a dialog allowing you to set mpv options for
                    playback.


INSTALLATION

    IG SpaceTV REQUIRES:

        spacefm v0.9.0 or later
        mpv
        mpv recommends: ffmpeg (or libav)
            See https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/FFmpeg-versus-Libav

    General Plugin Installation Instructions:
    http://ignorantguru.github.com/spacefm/spacefm-manual-en.html#plugins-install

    To have SpaceTV play all video files by default, first select (highlight)
    a video file in the file list.  Next right-click on the
    Play Video menu item and select Properties.  In the Properties dialog
    select the Context tab, and set "If enabled, use as opener for:" to
    'files'.  If you don't want it to play all video files, you can adjust the
    context rules to limit what is played.

    It's also recommended that you create the file ~/.mpv/input.conf, and add
    the following lines:

        HOME seek 0 absolute
        END seek +14400

    With this file in place, you can press the Home key in mpv to go to the
    beginning of a video, or press End to quit without saving a resume point.

    For best results, set key shortcuts for the Resume Last (Win+R) and
    Resume Prior (Win+Shift+R) menu items.  (Right-click on the menu item
    and select Key Shortcut to set a key.)  Or, you can set system-wide key
    shortcuts to run the following commands (so they will work outside of
    SpaceFM):

        # Resume Last
        ~/.mpv/spacetv/resume-last

        # Resume Prior
        ~/.mpv/spacetv/resume-last --resumepre

    Note that SpaceTV stores data in a 'spacetv' subfolder of mpv's config
    folder: ~/.mpv

    You must use the Play Video command once before the other commands can 
    be used (except Options).

    For greater customization, feel free to edit the spacetv.sh script. When 
    Play Video is first run, a link to the spacetv.sh script is created: 
    ~/.mpv/spacetv/resume-last.  The link is used by the Resume Last and 
    Resume Prior commands or may be executed directly.  Or to open this 
    script in SpaceFM, right-click on the Play Video menu item and select 
    Properties.  Click the Options tab and select Open In Browser: Command 
    Dir. Close the dialog and open the spacetv.sh script.

    The spacetv.sh script may also be used independently of SpaceFM to play
    videos, or resume the last or prior videos.  See spacetv.sh --help.
    This script only requires mpv, not SpaceFM.


INSTRUCTIONS

    Play Video will play selected video(s) in mpv and save resume points if
    the video does not play to the end.  When the same video is played again,
    it will resume where it left off, and the mpv volume and other settings
    will be restored to those used the last time this file was played.  Note
    that some resume functions only work if a single file is played at a time.
    mpv does not have a GUI, although there is a popup control panel.  For
    many useful key shortcuts see
        https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/DOCS/man/en/mpv.rst

    If you want to play a video using specific options, use Play Video w/
    Options.  This dialog also contains a scratchpad where notes or unused
    options can be stored. (You must use the Play Video command at least
    once after installation before the Play Video w/ Options command can be
    used.)  Press the Help button to open the mpv options manual.

    Resume Last will resume the last incomplete video.  It works by finding
    the most recently modified link in ~/.mpv/spacetv/watch_later_files/

    Resume Prior finds the last incomplete video and sets its timestamp to
    an old date.  Then it find the next most recent file and plays it.  The
    effect is that using Resume Prior multiple times will keep stepping
    backward through resumeable videos.  (Once you reach the beginning of the
    list, the order will be effectively random.)

    Browse Unfinished opens ~/.mpv/spacetv/watch_later_files/ in a tab of
    SpaceFM so you can view and play videos that have resume points.  You can
    also set a bookmark to this folder.  (Using a link to this folder may not
    work correctly, but this folder itself may be replaced by a link.)

    Options allows you to set options to be used when Play Video, Resume Last,
    or Resume Prior is used.  The Options dialog also contains a scratchpad
    where notes or unused options can be stored.
